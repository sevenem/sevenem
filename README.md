### About me

Hi, I'm sevenem.

I acknowledge the Turrbal and Yuggera Peoples upon whose land I live and pay my respects to Elders of the past, present and future. I would also like to acknowledge any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Peoples visiting this blog.

I decided to start learning programming before I get *too* old.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this blog and my first big project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as many programming languages as I can as fast as I can.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that I can offer something to.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with what to do next.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about learning Japanese.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I waited too long to start this.
